# Flex Panel Gallery

This project was built with starter code from the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

The task for this mini project was to build an interactive image gallery using JavaScript, but leaning heavy on CSS and flexbox.

This project involved centering elements vertically, hiding elements and then making them visible when clicked, as well as adjusting the sizes of flex items. Beyond the starter code and implementing the project, I chose my own panel images and uploaded a different font.

## What I learned:
- got more experience with translateY()
- toggling a class
- using "flex: 1" or "flex: 5" in our CSS
- I wanted to try the 'hover' event listener but 'click' provided a smoother transition
